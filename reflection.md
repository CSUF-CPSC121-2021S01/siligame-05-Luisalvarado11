# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
In this milestone, we updated some of our previous work into unique pointers. We added detection to the mouse function so that once we click it produces projectiles for player and opponents. We also added a score to keep track of the players score and also a message that says "GAME OVER" when player loses.
